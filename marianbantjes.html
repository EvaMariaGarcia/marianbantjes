<p>Marian Bantjes has told her story many times, so many times that she has grown bored of telling it. Although, she continues to tell it either way for its what made her. It shows her struggles from starting off as a regular designer to a famous graphic artist.</p>

<p>The Canadian artist being an atheist doesn't believe in fate but there is certain key changes that occurred in her career that would suggest otherwise and it all began at the beginning.</p>

<blockquote> <p>"As an atheist, I'm not comfortable with the notion of fate, but looking back over anyones life, its possible to see those turning points, those key twists in life that turn some random act of everyday living into a crossroads." </p> </blockquote>

<p>Her story began in 1983, at the age of 20 where she ventured into a bookstore to get change for the bus and she noticed an handwritten advert for a publishing company. When she accepted this job she had only dropped out of Emily Carr university art school a year earlier. Her new job was at Hartley & Marks/ Typeworks, she was simply hired just to do photocopying work but this then lead to her being trained in paste up and layout then eventually she became a typesetter.</p>

<p>She carried on this job for 10 years, it ended 1993 in an argument with her boss. Being highly trained in a section of typography with very little knowledge of crucial skills required to work in an design firm she and her friend Sue Kerr decided to start up on their own. They named the company Communication by Design, the first few years where their best. They eventually renamed the company 5 years later Digitopolis after she admitted in an meeting that she was embarrassed by their original name. The last two years of her company became disillusioned as Marian wasn't content she said ‘the business became a kind of a machine’. She wanted to be able to look back and see that she didn't waste her life. This was defiantly a major key change in her career. She says,</p>

<p>In 2002, Marians still feeling discontent her partner offered to buy her out. She agreed to stay one more year on contract and overjoyed began planning her future. Another key change in her career was in early 2003 she began hanging around on a blog called ‘Speak up’ made for designers it was from this that she knew she wanted to continue pursuing design. Once she finished in July 2003, she was only mildly known in Vancouver so she had to get her work out there by making self-promotion pieces she said ‘no answer was the stern reply’. She also spent her time being creative, drawing and exploring new ideas while writing for ‘Speak Up’. Everything seemed to be falling into place especially with Several turning points happened between July 2003 and August 2004 for Marian Bantjes.</p>
